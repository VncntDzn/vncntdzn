# Hello, World ðŸŒŽ! I'm Vincent ðŸ‘‹

### I'm currently working for Plooma as a software developer ðŸ’». Plooma is a start-up company here in the Philippines.
Before that I worked for Health Maintenance Inc. as a Web Developer and build many things for HMI.

As of 2021, I'm planning to use React as my primary library for frontend development but open for any interesting frontend frameworks.
My techstack is: React, React-Native, Vue.js, AWS, Firebase, MySQL, Node.js

 - I built several projects using Vue.js, Express.js and MySQL.
 - I'm also one of the developer of our school's website before I was studying.
 - I'm also one of the two developers of my previous company's official website and the developer of the admin panel for that website.
